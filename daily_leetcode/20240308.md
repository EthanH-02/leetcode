You are given an array `nums` consisting of **positive** integers.

Return _the **total frequencies** of elements in `nums` such that those elements all have the **maximum** frequency_.

The **frequency** of an element is the number of occurrences of that element in the array.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxFrequencyElements(vector<int>& nums) {
        int max_count = -1;
        map<int, int> count_map;
        for (int i: nums) {
            if (count_map.contains(i)) count_map[i]++;
            else count_map[i] = 1;
            max_count = (count_map[i] > max_count) ? count_map[i] : max_count;
        }

        int overall_count = 0;

        for (auto const& [key, val] : count_map) {
            if (val == max_count) overall_count += val;
        }

        return overall_count;
    }
};
