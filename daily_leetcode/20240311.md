You are given two strings `order` and `s`. All the characters of `order` are **unique** and were sorted in some custom order previously.

Permute the characters of `s` so that they match the order that `order` was sorted. More specifically, if a character `x` occurs before a character `y` in `order`, then `x` should occur before `y` in the permuted string.

Return _any permutation of `s` that satisfies this property_.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string customSortString(string order, string s) {
        unordered_map<char, int> charOrder;
        for (int i = 0; i < order.length(); ++i) charOrder[order[i]] = i;

        sort(s.begin(), s.end(), [&](char a, char b) {
            return charOrder[a] < charOrder[b];
        });
        return s;
    }
};
```
