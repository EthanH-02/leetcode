You start with an initial **power** of `power`, an initial **score** of `0`, and a bag of tokens given as an integer array `tokens`, where each `tokens[i]` donates the value of token_i.

Your goal is to **maximize** the total **score** by strategically playing these tokens. In one move, you can play an **unplayed** token in one of the two ways (but not both for the same token):

**Face-up**: If your current power is **at least** `tokens[i]`, you may play tokeni, losing `tokens[i]` power and gaining `1` score.
**Face-down**: If your current score is **at least** `1`, you may play tokeni, gaining `tokens[i]` power and losing `1` score.
Return _the **maximum** possible score you can achieve after playing **any** number of tokens_.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int bagOfTokensScore(vector<int>& tokens, int power) {
        sort(tokens.begin(), tokens.end());
        int left = 0, right = tokens.size() - 1;
        int score = 0, maxScore = 0;

        while (left <= right) {
            if (power >= tokens[left]) {
                power -= tokens[left++];
                score++;
                maxScore = max(maxScore, score);
            } else if (score > 0) {
                power += tokens[right--];
                score--;
            } else break;
        }

        return maxScore;
    }
};
