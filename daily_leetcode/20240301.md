You are given a **binary** string `s` that contains at least one `'1'`.

You have to **rearrange** the bits in such a way that the resulting binary number is the **maximum odd binary number** that can be created from this combination.

Return _a string representing the maximum odd binary number that can be created from the given combination_.

**Note** that the resulting string **can** have leading zeros.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string maximumOddBinaryNumber(string s) {
        string output(s.size(), '1');
        int z_count = 0;
        for(char& c : s) {
            if (c == '0') {
                output[s.size() - z_count - 2] = '0';
                z_count++;
            }
        }
        return output;
    }
};
```
